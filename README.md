Building a clone of the game 2048 following the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.

Almost done -- just need to let users choose their direction (i.e. don't always push numbers downwards) and check for the possibility of movement in that direction before spawning a random 2 or 4. And a tiny bit of styling, maybe animations.
