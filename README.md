# 2048
Building a clone of the game 2048 following the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.

Here's the [demo](https://zackstout.github.io/2048/).

## Rules:
- A move occurs when a player presses one of the arrow keys.
- After every move, a 2 or a 4 spawns in a random open cell.
- Each tile slides as far as it can; if it hits a tile with the same value, they merge.
- A merged tile cannot merge with another tile in the same move.
