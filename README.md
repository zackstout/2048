# 2048
Building a clone of the game 2048 following the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.

Almost done -- just need to let users choose their direction (i.e. don't always push numbers downwards) and check for the possibility of movement in that direction before spawning a random 2 or 4. And a tiny bit of styling, maybe animations.

## Rules:
- A move occurs when a player presses one of the arrow keys.
- After every move, a 2 or a 4 spawns in a random open cell.
- Each tile slides as far as it can; if it hits a tile with the same value, they merge.
- A merged tile cannot merge with another tile in the same move.
